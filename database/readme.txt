The database files for ligand based target searching: 

The all_lig_cof_database.mol2 file contains the ligand from ligand-protein complex in PDB database. It is obtained by processing the origanal dataset file from websever (http://insilab.org/datasets/).
Because the size of the database file all_lig_cof_database.mol2 is too large. We put it in https://figshare.com/account/home.

The DB_pdbbind.mol2 file contains small-molecule ligands that extracted from DB_pdbbind 2017 dataset(http://www.pdbbind.org.cn/)
Because the size of the database DB_pdbbind.mol2 is too large. We put it in https://figshare.com/account/home.
